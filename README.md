# Zombie
This is Zombie! An app that never dies, and keeps coming for your release files. It allows you to synch files from GitHub Releases directly to specified locations on the user drive. It runs continously in the background making sure that you are always up to date with your latest GitHub Release.

## How does Zombie work: 

1. Publish GitHub Release: [How to create a Release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
2. Get Access Token for that Repository: [How to create a Personal Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)
3. Setup Zombie File Mappings:
